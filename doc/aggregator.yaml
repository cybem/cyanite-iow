# This is yaml file which should have following structure:
#
# "tenant":
#   "<from regex>": "<to regex>"
#   "<from regex2>": "<to regex2>"
#
# Regular expressions should original Carbon aggregator rules, just reversed i.e. this from Carbon:
#
# <env>.applications.<app>.all.requests (60) = sum <env>.applications.<app>.*.requests
#
# Should become:
#
# "<env>.applications.<app>.*.requests": "sum.<env>.applications.<app>.all.requests"
#
# For example, this configuration will sum all internal metrics generated by Cyanite for each tenant:
#
# "cyanite":
#   "*.cyanite.tenants.<tenant>.<data>": "sum.cyanite.tenants.<tenant>.<data>"
#
#
# During conversion to Java regex, following rules apply:
#
# *         -> .*?          (non-greedy)
# .         -> \\.          (escaped dot)
# <name>    -> (?<name>.*?) ("from regex" only, non-greedy)
# <name>    -> ${name}      ("to regex" only)
#
#
# There is no sensible default. If enabled with empty configuration, aggregator logic will do nothing.
